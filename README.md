# EnumerateDS
By using this software, you can enumerate derivative structure on the methodology(Hart, Gus & Forcade, Rodney. (2008). Algorithm for generating derivative structures. Physical Review B. 77. 10.1103/PhysRevB.77.224115. ).

### How to use
you can enumerate binary derivative structures based on rutile structures.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python ./src/enumerate.py
```
